# flexible_cpm
Modified connectome-based predictive model. See preprint of book chapter outlining this method: https://osf.io/ay95f/

1) Enables inclusion of covariates at feature selection or model-building stage or both stages
2) Provides ability to threshold edges based on p-values (e.g. only select edges with  p-values for correlation between edge and target variable < .01) or sparsity (e.g. select top 7.5% of edges based on correlation bewteen edge and target variable)
3) Permits different choices of k-fold cross-validation schemes
4) Returns weights (i.e. regression coefficients) from trained model for external validation on other datasets
5) Creates masks for visualisation in bioimagesuite and enables creation of masks when restricted connectivity matrices are used (i.e. when nodes are removed from the original 268 x 268 connectivity matrix) 
6) Enables leave-site-out cross-validation
7) Optimises CPM for larger datasets via the use of parallel computing
